# Welcome! üëã

In the coming weeks we are going to stretch your Javascript knowledge and make you more confident with one of the most popular programming languages in the world üåè!

This program will be a combination of videos, 1 on 1 coaching sessions and most importantly writing Javascript!

Many of the concepts we will cover you may be familiar with but familiarity !== understanding.

That leads us to our philosophy on learning:

### You Learn Best By Doing!

We have laid out the most common concepts that confuse JS developers. Here's how we suggest you tackle this material.

1. Watch the videos under each sections `README.md`
2. Read any related articles that are linked
3. <strong>Everyone learns differently</strong> - feel free to look up these concepts using the medium you prefer to round out your knowledge
4. Each module has broken unit tests... you need to fix them with the correct code
5. Often times, the solution will be in the video in the `README.md` - DO NOT simply copy the answer from there! You will learn nothing
6. Reach out on slack and during your 1 x 1 sessions if you need help

We know that getting your dream job as a software engineer or excelling in your current role requires a strong technical foundation but that's not all!

Your LinkedIn, resume and general job strategy must be aligned with your goals and your mindset must be in the correct state to perform to the best of your ability.

We will go over job/interview strategy in other modules and templates.

### Setup

1. Fork this repo
2. In your terminal run `npm install`
3. To run tests - first unskip the tests in the file you are working on by removing all `skip`s. Then run `npm test`. To test a specific file: `npm test path/to/file.test.js`
4. Once you complete a module, send a quick video walking through your work and a screenshot of the passing tests (or include it in the video) via Slack
