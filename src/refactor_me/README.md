You will see the function `mergeArrays` in the file `mergeObject.js`

I mean, hey, it works.

But it could use some help. Like a lot.

### TODO

Refactor the function to improve the quality and peformance. You'll know your function works because the associated tests will still pass.

### BONUS

Create a short video explaining your refactor and the benefit of your changes.

The funny thing is that this function actually worked before the refactor. So what's the point of refactoring? When do you think it's appropriate vs ok to have some tech debt? **(This is a hotly debated topic)**
