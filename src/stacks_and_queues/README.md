# Stacks and Queues

### Your Turn:

1. What is FIFO? Is a stack FIFO? Is a queue?
2. What is LIFO? Is a stack LIFO? Is a queue?
3. Explain over a loom video how a native Javascript Array can be used as a stack or queue. Show some examples of code that mimics the behavior you expect to see for a stack and queue (you can use the course work here as an example).
