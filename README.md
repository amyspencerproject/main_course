# Welcome! 👋

The lessons in this repo are me stretching my Javascript knowledge and make you more confident with one of the most popular programming languages in the world 🌏!

Motto for these lessons: Familiarity !== understanding.


### You Learn Best By Doing!

How I tried to tackle the material.

1. Watched the videos under each sections `README.md`
2. Read the related articles that are linked and whatever else I need to understand the JS concept
3. Document what I am doing in a new `README.md`
4. Fix the broken unit test and then run the test
5. Make a Loom video of the material
